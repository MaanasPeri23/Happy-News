# Gumba Project
Gumba Project is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that combines two main features: a dog image gallery and a news feed. This project showcases various skills in iOS development, including SwiftUI, API integration, data modeling, third-party library usage, and natural language processing. This project helped understand more front-end IOS concepts than my other Swift Projects, and I hope to continue expanding my skillsets on SwiftUI as well as IOS development as a whole.

## Features

1. Dog Image Gallery
Fetches and displays random images of various dog breeds, including Alaskan Malamute, Golden Retriever, Samoyed, Chow Chow, and Husky, from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).
Retrieves and displays information about a random dog breed, such as name, breed group, bred for, temperament, and other details, from the TheDogAPI (https://thedogapi.com/).
Allows users to refresh and view new dog images and breed information with a simple button click.

2. News Feed
Integrates with the News API (https://newsapi.org/) to fetch and display news articles related to technology.
Performs sentiment analysis on article titles using Apple's NaturalLanguage framework.
Displays only articles with positive sentiment, providing a curated list of uplifting tech news.
Allows users to open and read full articles in their default web browser.

## Technologies Used

SwiftUI: The app is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative UI framework for building user interfaces across Apple platforms.
Networking: URLSession and the Codable protocol are used for making network requests and parsing JSON responses from various APIs.
Third-party Libraries: SwiftyJSON: A popular library for parsing JSON data in Swift, and SDWebImageSwiftUI: A library for asynchronous image loading and caching in SwiftUI.
Natural Language Processing: Apple's NaturalLanguage framework is utilized for sentiment analysis on news article titles.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases my following skills:

SwiftUI: Proficiency in building user interfaces with SwiftUI, including views, modifiers, and state management.
API Integration: Experience in integrating and consuming various APIs, handling network requests, and parsing JSON responses.
Data Modeling: Ability to create data models using Swift's Codable protocol and model complex data structures.
Third-party Library Integration: Knowledge of integrating and using third-party libraries to enhance app functionality.
Modular Design: Understanding of modular design principles and separating concerns in code organization.
Natural Language Processing: Basic understanding of natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis, using Apple's NaturalLanguage framework.

Getting Started
To run the Gumba Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Navigate to the project directory
Open the project in Xcode: open Gumba_Project.xcodeproj
Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

Note: Before running the app, make sure to obtain API keys for the Dog API, TheDogAPI, and News API, and add them to the appropriate places in the code.
